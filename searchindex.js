I Wanna Hate It  IWHI  is a podcast where a pair of idiots break down movies and shows Before watching, we view a trailer and declare whether we want to hate it, love it, or think it'll be cheesy  off-air, we watch it and take studious notes  lastly, we record a post-watch section recapping what we just saw so that we can definitively tell you, the audience, whether we hated it or not! We also have fun segments such as a death battle against previous episode characters, trivia, goofs, and educational content for the whole family!
